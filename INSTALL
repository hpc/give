Installation of 'give' and 'take'
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================

Manual Install:

	$ git clone git@git.lanl.gov:filesystems/give.git give-3.1-1 ****DON'T DO THIS YET, GITHUB HASN'T HAD THE NEW CODE PUSHED ONTO IT. IF YOU'RE READING THIS YOU HAVE THE CODE ALREADY ANYWAY :)	
	
	untar the downloaded package into the proper directory, name the "untared": give-3.1-1
	$ cd give-3.1-1
	$ ./configure [option1] [option2...]
	Edit Makefile: change bindir and mandir/man1 to match your directory structure
	also add the line, add this a line above chmod 4555: chown root:root give-assist (otherwise you will need to manually chown after installation)
	$ sudo make
	$ sudo make install

this will configure and install 'give' with basic options. There are two options that will 'effect' give at configure time:

	--enable-non-strict-checks..............this will cause give to stop checking that uid == default gid...........default: strict checks on
	--enable-givedir=DIR....................this will enable you to setup the proper givedir for your system........default: /usr/givedir

	***the directory you provide as DIR must exist, be owned by root, and be mode 0755. If those conditions aren't met 'give' will complain and quit.

the layout for this would be:
	$ ./configure --enable-non-strict-checks --enable-givedir=DIR

if no option(s) are passed to ./configure, the defaults are used. 
You can also run: $ ./configure --help for more info.

===============================================================================================================================================================================================================


RPM Build process:

The RPM has a few options to take into consideration:

	--define "strict_checks no".................turns strict checks off, the default has strict checking set to yes. This options only takes in: no, No, or NO. If you want strict checks on, don't define it. It's set on by default.
	--define "alt_givedir /my/givedir/".........allows you to set your own givedir location. Default is set to /usr/givedir

	***the directory you provide as DIR must exist, be owned by root, and be mode 0755. If those conditions aren't met 'give' will complain and quit.

	build with no options:

		from a tar:	rpmbuild -ta give-3.1-1.tgz
		
		from a spec:	rpmbuild -ba path_to_spec_file/give.spec

	build with non-strict checks only:

		from a tar:	rpmbuild -ta give-3.1-1.tgz --define "strict_checks no"
		
		from a spec:	rpmbuild -ba path_to_spec_file/give.spec --define "strict_checks no"

	with both options:

		from a tar:	rpmbuild -ta give-3.1-1.tgz --define "alt_givedir /desired/givedir" --define "strict_checks no"
		
		from a spec:	rpmbuild -ba path_to_spec_file/give.spec --define "alt_givedir /desired/givedir" --define "strict_checks no"

===============================================================================================================================================================================================================

However you decide to install, be sure to check the give-assist file perms to ensure the owner is root and the suid bit is set. 
If the perms are wrong, they can be changed to the proper perms with the following commands:

$ chown root:root <location of give-assist binary>
$ chmod 4555 <location of give-assist binary>


Finally, you should validate proper operation and check it against your test and security plans.
